I'm following the [RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/1luh8og/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial) tutorial but with c + ncurses!
This is probably going to both be the roguelike tutorial and also a roguelike engine (yes I know... I'm making *yet another* engine...)

Excuse the poor code... I haven't used c in a while so it's really bad :'(
